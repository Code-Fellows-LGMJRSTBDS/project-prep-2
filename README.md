## Daily Checklist (daylist.io)

Similar to wunderlist. It is an app that lets you check off tasks that you want to remind yourself to do everyday. Over the week, the app shows your performance of how many times you completed each task, with a chart. 

## What problem or pain point does it solve

A lot of checklist apps don't have a "repeat" task over the week feature, or data visualization features. there are tasks we want to include in our routines everyday, or task we want to accomplish several times over the week. This apps lets us track our performance over the week for completing those tasks. 

## MVP

+ constructor function
+ save the tasks to local storage
+ user input - new tasks
+ each checklist is an array of a list
+ need to be able to display tasks, add tasks, strike through them once they are completed, and view a graph that shows your performance for the week

## Second Project - Hangman App

Use the Hangman game as a tool for vocabulary learning of "programming definitions/words". When you're done with the game it will display the word and the definition that we've included. 

Using flashcards to study can be boring and repetitive, but "gamifying" this can make it more fun and engaging.

MVP - displaying images that represent how many lives you have left, while answering by populating the page with the definition of each "programming" related term.
